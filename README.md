# Cado Engineering Career Ladder

We found the open-source Engineering Career Ladder from Gitlab super useful when developing our own Engineering Career ladder (https://handbook.gitlab.com/job-families/engineering/).

To that end, we've open sourced our Engineering Career Ladder (much based on Gitlab's) which may be useful for mid-size startups (20-100 people).

If you like the sound of what we're up to - we're currently hiring @ https://www.cadosecurity.com/careers/ !

## Engineering Manager
Engineering Managers at Cado see their team as their product. While they are technically credible and spend time contributing to the code-base, at least a third of their time is spent safeguarding their team's health, hiring a world-class team, and putting them in the best position to succeed. They own the delivery of product commitments and are always looking to improve productivity. They also coordinate across departments to accomplish collaborative goals.

-   Make your team feel safe and supported.
-   Generate and implement process improvements.
